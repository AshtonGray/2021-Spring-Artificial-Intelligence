A weighted 8-puzzle solver using different search stratigies with different heuristics.


The 8-puzzle:
The 8-puzzle consists of eight tiles on a 3x3 grid, with one open ("blank") square. The possible configurations of tiles
comprise a state space, where the goal state has the open square in the upper left, with the
other tiles arranged in numeric order from left to right.

Valid moves are Up, Down, Left, and Right

Code:
Four different search strategies are used: Breadth-first, uniform-cost, greedy best-first, and A* to solve the puzzle
